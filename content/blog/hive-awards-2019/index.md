## The HIVE Blackburn & Darwen Business Awards

The HIVE Blackburn & Darwen Business Awards are dedicated to celebrating and rewarding the exceptional achievements of businesses spanning various sectors and inspirational individuals hailing from the vibrant community of Blackburn & Darwen.

These prestigious awards encompass a wide range of categories, recognizing outstanding businesses across all sectors as well as honoring individual entrepreneurs and exemplary services. The judging process is rigorous and impartial, featuring a panel comprising both internal and external representatives, including our own Ian Parkinson.

The judging panel diligently reviews and pre-scores all entry forms, taking into account any accompanying materials provided. The combined pre-scores determine the shortlisted nominees, and judges convene to discuss and select winners for each category. Shortlisted companies in the individual business categories undergo face-to-face interviews.

The 2019 awards ceremony, held on Thursday, June 27, 2019, at King George’s Hall in Blackburn, was a memorable evening, as always. In addition to our role in judging and sponsoring the awards, we had the privilege of designing and producing the coveted award trophies presented to the deserving winners.
