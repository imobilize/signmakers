Discover the power of precision spray coverage with Saturn Spraying's Spinning Disc Technology. From 'Top Only' to 'Top & Sides' and 'Top & Bottom' configurations, explore how this innovative system delivers uniform and consistent spraying of oils, flavors, liquids, and nuts onto various food products. Experience blockage-resistant delivery, easy maintenance, and enhanced control with digital potentiometer technology.

# Top Only Spray Coverage

A spinning disc with a focusing aperture lays down a simple spray pattern, perpendicular to the direction of product travel; that graduates in the strength of the spray linearly across its length. In certain applications, this can be very effective in providing a simple two-dimensional or “Top Only” spraying system. Note: The disc is inclined to improve the quality of the spray and to channel unused spray material back to the reservoir.

For a more effective application of spray liquid in a top only mode; two contra-rotating disc heads are used. The discs are grouped closely* together to provide a consistent, uniform spray directly over the product. A balanced stainless steel manifold ensures that the pump output is evenly distributed to each spray head. Spray material that is not deposited on the product is collected under the conveyor and channelled back to the reservoir. When used for spraying meat pies in foil bases, for example; this configuration helps protect the foil from being sprayed.


Precision Inverter/Motor Control Systems provides digital control to the Spinning Disc Speed, Pump Speed and the Conveyor Speed. This provides a unique signature for each machine set-up. Product changeovers can be quickly accommodated by entering the signature code into the machine for the appropriate machine configuration. The precision accuracy inherent in the system ensures it correctly returns to an identical set up as the last batch for that particular product.

A proportion of the pump output is returned directly to the reservoir tank, which provides:-
- Improved control of the spray application rate.
- Continuous recirculation that inhibits separation of emulsions.
- Enhanced temperature stabilisation of the spray.

# Top & Sides Spray Coverage
A spinning disc with a focusing aperture lays down a simple spray pattern; perpendicular to the direction of product travel, that graduates in the strength of the spray linearly across its length. In certain applications, this can be very effective in providing a simple two-dimensional or “Top Only” spraying system. For “Top & Sides" coverage, a single disc is not sufficient. Note: The disc is inclined to improve the quality of the spray and to channel unused spray material back to the reservoir.

In Top & Sides spraying, it is important to ensure that the spray pattern covers evenly and with precision the key surfaces:
- Top Surface
- Front Leading Face
- Left Side Face
- Right Side Face
- Rear Trailing Face
To create a spray pattern for "Top & Sides"; we use a pair of contra-rotating discs. The spray patterns of each disc in this configuration merge with the other; to provide an even homogenous precision coverage of spray material across the full width of the system. The discs are arranged in a "V" shape; so that the front and rear of the product can be sprayed. A balanced stainless steel manifold ensures that the pump output is evenly distributed to each spray head. Spray material that is not deposited on the product is collected under the conveyor and channelled back to the reservoir.

The effectiveness of the "Top & Sides" coverage is also dependent upon the shape or profile of the product itself; as well as on the potential masking of the spray by adjacent products on the conveyor system. In such circumstances, we may use multiple spinning discs; ganged together as contra-rotating pairs. This provides the flexibility to create a configuration for consistent and uniform spray across the spray bed.

A balanced stainless steel manifold ensures that the pump output is evenly distributed to each spray head. Spray material that is not deposited on the product is collected under the conveyor and channelled back to the tank. Precision Inverter/Motor Control Systems provide digital control to the spinning disc speed, pump speed and the conveyor speed.

#### Digital Potentiometer

This provides a unique signature for each machine set-up. Product changeovers can be quickly accommodated, by entering the signature code into the machine for the appropriate machine configuration. The accuracy inherent in the system ensures it correctly returns to an identical set up as the last batch for that particular product.
A proportion of the pump output is returned directly to the reservoir tank, which provides:-
- Improved control of the spray application rate.
- Continuous recirculation inhibits separation of emulsions.
- Enhances the temperature stabilisation of the spray.

# Top & Bottom Spray Coverage
Sometimes referred to as "All Over Spraying" this configuration requires a minimum of two pairs of contra-rotating disc heads. The appropriate "Top Only" or "Top & Sides" configuration, is augmented with a further pair of discs located under the conveyor; spraying the underside of the products. In this way, we can ensure that the spray pattern is extended to spray the key areas:

2D Product
- Top Surface
- Underside Surface

3D Product
- Top Surface
- Front Leading Face
- Left Side Face
- Right Side Face
- Rear Trailing Face
- Underside Surface

### Top & Bottom System Schematic

The rotating pairs are configured to provide a consistent and uniform spray over and underneath the spray bed. A balanced stainless steel manifold ensures that the pump output is evenly distributed to each spray head. Spray material that is not deposited on the product is collected under the conveyor and channelled back to the tank.
