## Wall and Building Lettering
### Make Your Branding Stand Out

Wall and building lettering is customizable to your measurements and specifications. It can be temporary or permanent and include photos or vibrant messages. Letters can be created in various sizes and colors to reflect your brand requirements and personality. These types of installations can include everything from dimensional letters to channel letters, sometimes lit or backlit.

Here are a variety of ways that you might see wall and building lettering being used:
- Within an office, medical facility or organization lobby
  Dimensional letters and signs are often incorporated onto a wall in a lobby or behind a front desk so anyone who enters knows they are in the correct location. This type of sign can also assist with creating and maintaining brand recognition in any industry. Custom dimensional signs are often found in highly visible areas, and sign experts can help you decide what medium of sign creativity might be best for welcoming your guests inside. These types of signs are an eye-catching art piece inside lobbies. Many well-known companies employ unique lobby signs as one way to showcase their logo, slogans, mottos and more.
- Inside a church
  Wall lettering can be seen at an Info center in a religious organization or on the exterior of the building as a way to create brand consistency.
- Throughout a restaurant, retail or corporate space
  Often, slogans, branding statements, company values and more are great ways to create a comprehensive branding strategy within a location.
- Hung in conference and training rooms
  For employees, customers and visitors alike, dimensional signs can provide a focal point and make a statement that reinforces your brand and/or message. Businesses can combine dimensional letters with other sign materials to create custom graphics that stand out from the wall and look like art.
- Exterior dimensional signs
  These larger than life signs installed on the exterior of a building provide a visual marker, signaling traffic to a desired location. Building signs can use dimensional letters and logos to provide brand awareness and draw visitors or customers into your space.

*Which type of building letter is preferable, plastic or metal?* Metal letters offer a strong, long-lasting appearance but come at a higher cost. Plastic three-dimensional letters boast an appealing glossy surface and are more economical than metal counterparts. While the former is heavier with its unique texture, plastic versions are lightweight and less expensive to manufacture in shorter time
