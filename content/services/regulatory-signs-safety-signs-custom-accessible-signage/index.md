For ADA compliance, signage must use contrasting colors, sans-serif fonts, and include both braille and raised text for the visually impaired. Tactile signs should have uppercase lettering between ⅝” and 2” in height, with proper spacing between characters and edges. ADA signs should be installed on the latch side of the door and not directly on the door; if space is limited, they can be placed on the nearest adjacent wall in a clearly visible spot."

When it comes to regulations, it's vital to be transparent about your compliance efforts. The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 mandates that buildings must be accessible to individuals with disabilities, necessitating ADA signage throughout your property. These signs should be an integral part of your overall visual communication strategy.

## What Are ADA and Regulatory Signs?

Regulatory signs convey the policies and safety precautions your business implements to safeguard its visitors. Sign Makers offers regulatory signs that inform visitors of laws, regulations, and requirements.

These signs are commonly found in areas such as:

- Stairwells
- Elevators
- Fire exits
- Entryways
- Parking lots

If you need to inform your customers about these policies, the Sign Makers team is here to help you effectively deliver your message. These signs are essential in public spaces and work areas, and they should always be placed where they are highly visible and easy to read.

## ADA Sign Requirements

Consider the following ADA sign requirements when developing your signage plan:

- ADA signage must exhibit a contrast in both the background and text colors.
- ADA-compliant signs must use a sans-serif font with no additional features.
- If a sign contains a pictogram identifying a permanent space, tactile text descriptors are necessary.
- Pictograms may include symbols like a wheelchair or gender symbols for specific restrooms.
- Braille lettering must be placed below the text and centered, with a minimum of 3/8" spacing from other sign elements, including sign borders. ADA sign text must have a minimum 3/8" space from the sign's edge.
- For tactile signs, the lettering must be uppercase and between ⅝” and 2” in height.
- Individual characters should be spaced at 1/16" to 1/8" minimum apart and 1 1/5" maximum from each other.
- All ADA-compliant signs must include both braille letters and raised text for the visually impaired.
- For tactile signs, the ADA requires the baseline of the lowest raised character to be a minimum of 48” above the finished floor, and the baseline of the highest raised character to be a maximum of 60” above the finished floor.
- Interior ADA signs should be installed on the latch side of the door of the labeled room.
- ADA signs should not be mounted directly on a door.
- If there isn't sufficient space to mount the sign in the specified location, it may be installed on the nearest adjacent wall in a clearly visible spot.
