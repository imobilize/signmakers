## Convey Your Brand Message with LED Signs, Boards, and Displays

LED Displays are made up of many smaller light-emitting diodes close together that are used to create and project images. They can feature messages with vivid, high contrast content—from images to video. Bring the excitement up close and personal by renting large LED Displays. Indoors or out, they ensure there’s not a bad seat in the house.

**Benefits of Using LED Displays**
- **High Impact and High Visibility:** Large LED displays allow the action to come front and center to keep crowds engaged in your event. Also, LED displays make the best use of your venue by spreading the viewing area across a large, socially distanced audience.
- **High Level of Experience:** With a turn-key LED Display rental program, Parkinson Signs makes it easier than ever to pull off an amazing experience.

Parkinson Signs can provide screens in all shapes and sizes. From a simple 4’ x 6’ indoor board for a church event up to a 10’ x 20’ outdoor board for a festival in the park, these boards come with all of the hardware needed, including the LED board modules, frame/stand, video controller, and extra parts for any repairs. Plus, Parkinson Signs includes an on-site installation crew that will receive and set up the boards, and then tear them down and ship them back after the event/rental is concluded.

**Applications for Using LED Displays**
- **Stadiums:** enable sports fans to get the full experience with celebrity-style signs and graphics
- **Venues:** bring live music center stage for eager fans
- **Festivals:** level up at a community event with enhanced technology
- **Conventions:** enliven your next corporate event or tradeshow by incorporating a modern look and feel with LED Displays
