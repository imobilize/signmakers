## Digital Display Boards
### Visually Communicate Your Brand Message Quickly and Conveniently

Digital display boards have a wide variety of jobs and can help you accomplish an array of challenges. Whether you need to help visitors get where they need to go, inform someone of all that your space has to offer as well as upcoming events, or welcome new prospects with brand recognition, this solution is the perfect tool for the job.

## Digital Kiosks
### Elevate Your Brand Message with Digital Sign Kiosks

Digital kiosks are self-contained sign options for helping you communicate multiple messages in the same compact space. They can be placed in a lobby, retail area, waiting area, hallway, break room, or any other location. They are an easily changeable option, and you can make immediate changes to the content by adding a media player to the digital kiosk. Scheduling of content can be executed locally or remotely over the internet.

## Digital Menu Boards
### Integrate Your Brand Message with a Dynamic Digital Menu Display

A digital menu board is a sleek, electronic display of the menu you provide at your locale. Often displayed on a television screen, they can also be mounted on the wall. These applications vibrantly display a host of options for your customers to easily view before they get to the point of purchase. Digital menu boards also provide the ability to change messaging to better match your viewer’s needs. Parkinson Signs provides professional-grade digital menu boards that can display during specific desired time frames or be up 24/7.
