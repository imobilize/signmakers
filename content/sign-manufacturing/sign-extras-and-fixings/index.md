Acrylic Sign Locators
---------------------

To mount your sign to a wall there are several options available. **Acrylic sign locators** work by having both male and female components. The male component gets bonded to the back of the sign panel (or **sign blank**) and the female part gets located in a drilled out hole.

This allows the [sign panel](/sign-blanks) to be mounted easily and **fitting templates** can be supplied to ensure holes are drilled in the correct locations.

Brass & Nickel Sign Locators
----------------------------

Another option to mount your sign to the wall (or other surface) is to use **Brass or Nickel sign locators**. These work similar to **acrylic sign locators** in that they usually have two parts (a male and female).

There are several fixing types available: external threaded, internal threaded and fixed woodscrew. They are durable, long lasting and suitable for all weather conditions. **Fitting templates** can be supplied along with a **Fabricut Fitting Guide**.

Threaded Studs
--------------

Threaded M4 studs (or pins) are welded onto the rear of stainless steel or aluminium signage. The studs can be used for sinking into pilot holes in walls for a flush finish.

Alternatively we can supply acrylic spacers (sleeves) that will space your sign or lettering away from the wall. Supplied with fitting templates.

Very High Bonding (VHB) Tape
----------------------------

This is a commercial use, double-sided, ultra strong adhesive tape ideal for general sign fixings. When we say “ultra strong”, we mean it! When using **VHB Tape** for the first time it can be daunting; putting your trust in double-sided tape. But once you have used it, you’ll see just how strong it is.

It’s great for the hanging of simple non-removable **sign panels** or bonding things like [flat cut letters](/flat-cut-letters-and-signs) to walls, etc.

Paper Fixing Templates
----------------------

Positioning a sign can be tricky business, but with a [Fabricut](/) fitting template (or **paper fixing template**) it makes your job easy. Simply request one with your sign order and then when on site, position to your wall or substrate with masking tape and drill your fixing holes as indicated on the template.

Vinyl Fitting & Paint Stencils
------------------------------

We use high quality low tack **MACmask** from **Mactac** for our stencils, which is less likely to cause damage to paintwork than standard vinyl. These can also be cut and supplied for use as a paint mask for spray painting.
