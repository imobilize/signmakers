Flat Cut Signs, The Economical First Choice
-------------------------------------------

**Flat cut letters** (or **signs**) are always a popular option, as they’re more economical and quicker to produce than the alternative [built up letters and signs](/built-up-letters-and-signs). They use minimal material and are also extremely lightweight, which makes these signs easy to install too.

When fitted with our “off the wall” locator fixings, this method can give these signs an eye-catching 3D look (when viewed from the front). The sheer variety of finishes available also makes them an attractive choice for many **trade sign makers**.
