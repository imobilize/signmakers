## What the Client Wanted
The Horlicks Quarter in Slough, through MSA Creative, required a variety of signage, including illuminated lettering and a bold graphic, to create a grand entrance.


## About the Process:
We installed illuminated rimless lettering for both the interior and exterior, LED-style faux neon for the entrance, and a striking oversized vertical graphic for the brickwork. Together, these elements create an impressive and cohesive entrance that enhances the building's presence.
