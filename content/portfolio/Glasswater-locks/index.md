## What the Client Wanted
MSA Design, on behalf of Berkeley Homes, wanted a striking sign that would look impressive both day and night, featuring a unique lighting effect.


## About the Process:
We crafted a sign using double-layered acrylic, which was edge-lit to create a glowing effect around the lettering. This design element adds depth and visual interest, especially in low light. An evening shot would beautifully showcase the full effect of the illuminated acrylic, highlighting the thoughtful design and craftsmanship.
