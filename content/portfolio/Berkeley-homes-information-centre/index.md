## What the Client Wanted
Berkeley Homes needed signage for their Information Centre at Huntley Wharf in Reading, and we completed this project with MSA Design.


## About the Process:
We delivered signage that was sleek and understated, focusing on clarity and precision. The clean finish aligned perfectly with Berkeley Homes' brand and the overall aesthetic of the project.
