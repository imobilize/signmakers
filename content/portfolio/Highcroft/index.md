## What the Client Wanted
Berkeley Homes needed halo-illuminated built-up lettering and a logo for their Highcroft marketing suite in Wallingford, along with face-lit rimless script text.


## About the Process:
We designed and installed the illuminated signage, focusing on creating a bright and inviting display. Although we didnâ€™t capture shots of the signs lit up, the quality and design speak for themselves, adding a touch of sophistication to the marketing suite.
