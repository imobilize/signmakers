## What the Client Wanted
 Kingsbury, our long-standing client, wanted a sharp and modern sign that would stand out, featuring 3D lettering with lighting effects.


## About the Process:

We created 3D letters from mirror-polished stainless steel, adding a soft halo illumination to make the letters glow. These were mounted onto a durable, powder-coated aluminium tray sign, giving it a clean and smart appearance. The result is a polished look that perfectly matches Kingsburyâ€™s branding.
