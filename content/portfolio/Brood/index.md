## What the Client Wanted
 Brood at Borough Market needed new LED acrylic-style ‘neon’ letters to refresh their signage in time for their reopening.


## About the Process:
We supplied and installed the vibrant LED letters well ahead of their reopening date. The signage adds a lively and inviting touch to the market, helping Brood attract customers as they get ready to serve their delicious food again.
