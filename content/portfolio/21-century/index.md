## What the Client Wanted
 Century21 needed a small but perfectly formed tray and entrance panel for their location, reflecting their brand's professionalism.


## About the Process:
We designed and installed a compact tray and entrance panel that is both functional and visually appealing. Despite its size, the new signage delivers a strong impact, perfectly representing Century21's brand.
