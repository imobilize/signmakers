## What the Client Wanted
Berkeley Homes, through our friends at MSA Creative, wanted clean and sleek signage that would add a touch of elegance to their project, featuring monoliths with illuminated details.


## About the Process:

 We crafted monoliths with intricate edge-illuminated lettering, giving the text a soft glow. The brushed gold face adds a luxurious touch, enhancing the overall look. The result is a refined and stylish sign that aligns perfectly with Berkeley Homes' sophisticated image.
