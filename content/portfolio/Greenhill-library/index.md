## What the Client Wanted
Harrow Council’s newest library, Greenhill, needed external signage for the entrance canopy, and we were excited to be involved in this project, the third library we've worked on with them.


## About the Process:
 Collaborating with Objectif Graphic Design, we manufactured and installed the signage for the new development in Harrow Square. The result is a visually appealing and fitting addition to the library’s modern entrance.
